#
# Iteration state for the PR review loop. One JSON file per PR under
# .claude/state/pr-review/ (gitignored — it is per-machine, per-moment scratch).
#
# The loop it drives: review -> adjudicate -> fix -> re-review, until no
# CRITICAL/HIGH findings remain or the round cap is hit. Both halves matter.
# Without re-review, a fix that introduces a new defect ships unnoticed (that is
# exactly what happened in practice before this loop existed). Without a cap, it never terminates — a
# high-effort reviewer nearly always emits *something*.
#
# Usage:
#   pr-review-state.sh seed <pr> <url> [session]  open a loop (exit 3 if already open)
#   pr-review-state.sh reviewing <pr>             a review is in flight; gate goes quiet
#   pr-review-state.sh record <pr> <blocking>     finish a round; 0 blocking => done
#   pr-review-state.sh reject <pr> <what> <why>   remember a finding judged wrong
#   pr-review-state.sh clear <pr>                 abandon the loop for this PR
#   pr-review-state.sh status [session]           print unresolved state (READ-ONLY)
#   pr-review-state.sh gate-tick [session]        status, count a block, run cleanup
#
# Output from status/gate-tick is line-prefixed so the gate can classify it:
#   BLOCK|  the turn must not end
#   WARN|   tell the user, but do not block (a loop that ended badly)
#
# "blocking" is the count of CONFIRMED CRITICAL/HIGH findings from that round.
# MEDIUM and LOW are reported once and never looped on — per code-review.md only
# CRITICAL blocks and HIGH warns, and looping on nits does not converge.

MAX_ROUNDS=3
# If the gate blocks this many times without a round being recorded, the loop is
# stuck (review tool unavailable, protocol being ignored) and it gives up rather
# than wedging the session. This is THE wedge guard, so nothing may reset it
# except an actually recorded round.
MAX_GATE_BLOCKS=6
# A review may be declared in-flight at most this many times per round. Without a
# cap, answering every block with `reviewing` would extend the quiet period
# indefinitely and defeat MAX_GATE_BLOCKS.
MAX_REVIEWING_PER_ROUND=2
TTL_SECONDS=$((24 * 60 * 60))
# How long a review may be in flight before the gate stops believing in it. The
# observed reviews took 6-9 minutes, so this is generous but not open-ended.
REVIEW_GRACE_SECONDS=$((20 * 60))
# How long the PR-state lookup may take. The gate hook has a 10s budget; a hook
# killed for overrunning it cannot warn, so enforcement would drop silently.
PR_STATE_TIMEOUT=3
# And one budget for a whole gate tick, since it may check several loops in turn:
# no lookup starts after this many seconds; the rest count as not checked.

# variable is unset) fell back to `git rev-parse` of whatever the cwd happened to
# be. From a worktree or another repo that silently pointed at a different tree:
# the model could not close the loop, and the gate went on demanding an action
# that could never succeed until the wedge guard gave up six turns later.
