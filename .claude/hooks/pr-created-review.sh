# PostToolUse / Bash hook.
#
# After a `gh pr create` that actually produced a PR, open a review loop for that
# PR and tell Claude the protocol. This hook only SEEDS the loop — it fires once
# and cannot fire again, so it cannot enforce anything. The Stop hook
# (pr-review-gate.sh) is what keeps the loop running.
#
# Detection keys off the RESPONSE, not the command, because the command cannot be
# matched reliably without a shell parser. Two rounds of review proved that:
#
#   - a loose substring match fired for a `jq` call that merely quoted the words
#   - anchoring to command boundaries then UNDER-matched the most natural idiom,
#     `PR_URL=$(gh pr create --fill)`, so the hook silently never armed at all
#   - the boundary chars still matched inside quoted literals, so it over-matched
#     and under-matched simultaneously
#
# What is reliable: a successful `gh pr create` prints the new PR's URL as a line
# on STDOUT, by itself. So the response must contain a line that is *exactly* a
# PR URL, and the command match is only a cheap prefilter. Reading stdout alone
# also rejects the failure case, where `gh` reports "a pull request for branch X
# already exists: <url>" on STDERR — that must not open a loop on someone else's PR.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION, stated plainly because an earlier version of this comment
# claimed a fix it did not have: if the command captures or redirects gh's stdout
# (`PR_URL=$(gh pr create --fill)`, or a pipe), the tool response carries no URL
# and no loop opens. That is not fixable from the payload — the URL never reaches
# the tool. The repo's own `/work-next-item` uses the uncaptured form, so the
# primary path arms; a hand-written capturing variant silently will not, and you
# must open the loop yourself with `pr-review-state.sh seed <pr> <url>`.

# Cloud sessions have no gh CLI and create PRs with the GitHub MCP tool instead,

# Its result is structured, so read the PR's own URL field rather than scanning
# text: `url`/`html_url` of the created PR, possibly inside a text block holding
# JSON. Only a github.com/<o>/<r>/pull/<n> URL qualifies, which rules out the REST
# API's .../pulls/<n> `url`, and only top-level fields count, so a PR merely
# linked from the new PR's body cannot be mistaken for it.
