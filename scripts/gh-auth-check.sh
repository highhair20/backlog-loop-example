# Can gh act on this repo? Checks gh's login for the host the repo's origin points
# at, prints that host, and exits with gh's status: 0 when logged in.
#
# A bare `gh auth status` tests every host and account gh has stored, and exits 1
# if any of them has a problem (see `gh auth status --help`). So a stale token for
# some unrelated GitHub Enterprise host made the loop and setup.sh report gh as
# logged out (#15). Checking the origin's host keeps GitHub Enterprise repos working
# too, where hard-coding github.com would break them.
#
# With no origin, or an origin with no host (a local path), there is no host to
# pick: it checks every host as before, and prints nothing.
