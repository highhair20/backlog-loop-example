# Sync this template's GitHub-flow guardrails into an existing repo.
#
# Three kinds of file, handled differently so a re-run never clobbers local work:
#
#   managed  — overwritten every run. Files with no per-repo content (the PR
#              review hooks, the backlog loop command and driver); a local edit
#              there is drift, and drift is the bug. Repo specifics go in CLAUDE.md.
#   seeded   — copied only when missing. Files each repo is expected to tailor
#              (CLAUDE.md, CI, issue templates, the issue and CI guides).
#   merged   — .claude/settings.json keeps the repo's own rules and hooks and
#              gains the template's; .gitignore gains only missing lines.
#
# Nothing is committed. The target must start clean, so `git diff` afterwards is
# exactly what the sync changed — review it, then commit on a branch.
#
# Usage (from a clone of the template): scripts/sync-guardrails.sh <target-repo-dir>
# The installer plugin's /backlog-loop:install and :update run it the same way,
# from the plugin's installed copy of the template.
