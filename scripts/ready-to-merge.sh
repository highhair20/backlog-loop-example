# Tells the maintainer when one of the loop's PRs is ready to merge (#88). A loop PR
# (branch <type>/<N>-<slug>) is ready when its issue is in-review (the loop is done
# with it), it has no changes-requested label, and GitHub's mergeStateStatus is CLEAN:
# required checks pass and, under a strict ruleset, it is up to date with main.
#
# A ready PR gets the ready-to-merge label and one comment mentioning its assignees,
# once per head commit (marked, so a rerun does not repeat it). The comment says the
# branch includes its base only when the compare API shows it is not behind (without
# a strict ruleset GitHub reads a behind branch as CLEAN), and names the base commit
# it was judged against, "includes main at abc1234": the comment is never revisited,
# so once main moves on it still says only what was true (#114). A labelled PR that
# is no longer ready loses the label, and so does one still UNKNOWN (GitHub still
# computing) after the retries: a missing label costs a run, a false one a bad merge.
#
# This workflow's own run puts a check on the PR it judges, so while it runs (or once
# a newer run has replaced it) GitHub reads the PR UNSTABLE. That check is set aside:
# UNSTABLE with every other check passing counts as CLEAN (#110). The PR is read
# again just before anything is written, so a label or push since the listing wins.
#
# Run by .github/workflows/ready-to-merge.yml; safe to run by hand.
# Usage: scripts/ready-to-merge.sh   (gh must be authenticated for the repo)
