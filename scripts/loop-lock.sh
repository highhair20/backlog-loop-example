# The backlog loop's single-instance lock: a directory in the repo's git directory
# holding the PID of the run that took it. It lives there, not in LOG_DIR, so every
# run in this clone (and its worktrees, which share one backlog) meets the same lock,
# and git never offers it for commit.
#
# scripts/backlog-loop.sh takes the lock for as long as it runs. /work-next-item only
# checks it: a Claude session has no stable PID to record and no reliable moment to
# release, so an interactive run yields to a driver but does not exclude one.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/loop-lock.sh acquire <pid>   take the lock for the running process <pid>
#   scripts/loop-lock.sh release <pid>   drop the lock, if <pid> holds it
#   scripts/loop-lock.sh check           may a run start here? (what /work-next-item asks)
#   scripts/loop-lock.sh path            print the lock's absolute path
#
# `check` passes when the lock is free, stale, or held by the driver that started
# this session, which exports its PID as BACKLOG_LOOP_PID.
#
# Exit: 0 ok · 1 another run holds the lock · 2 usage or environment error.
# Anything but 0 means "do not start".
