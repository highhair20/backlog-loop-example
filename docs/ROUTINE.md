# Running the loop as a scheduled routine

A Claude Code [routine](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/routines) can run
`/work-next-item` on a schedule in Anthropic's cloud, so the backlog is worked
without anyone starting the loop. Each run is a fresh cloud session with its own
clone, and works at most one issue under the same command and guardrails as a local
run. It is scheduling around the loop, not a second engine.

## Before you start

- **`scripts/setup.sh` passes**: a real `## Verify`, the labels (including the
  proposal labels), and the `protect-main` ruleset. The ruleset matters most here:
  GitHub enforces it whatever the session does, while the repo's deny rules may not
  apply in a routine at all (see the first dry run).
- **Turn the proposal gate on** in `CLAUDE.md`, so no hand-written issue becomes a PR
  before you have read its plan:
  ```markdown
  ## Proposal gate

  - Gate: on
  - Machine-filed label: none
  ```
  Name a machine-filed label only for issues your own automation files with evidence
  attached (a triage agent, say); those skip the proposal.
- **Label what it must never touch** `no-auto-heal`: infrastructure, secrets, the
  loop's own plumbing.
- **Give the cloud environment what Verify needs.** The session has a fresh clone
  and the environment's tools. Install anything else (a linter, a toolchain) in the
  environment's setup script; a Verify command that cannot run makes every
  implement run give up.
- **Grant GitHub access.** A routine reaches GitHub as you, through the Claude GitHub
  App. Its installation must cover this repository with access to contents, issues,
  and pull requests. A 403 in the first run means it does not.

## Create the routine

Routines are created interactively, so `setup.sh` cannot do this for you. Run
`/schedule` in a Claude Code session in the repo, or use claude.ai/code/routines:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | this repository |
| Prompt | `/work-next-item --dry-run` |
| Schedule | hourly (`0 * * * *`), the shortest interval routines allow |
| Model | the model you run the loop with locally |

## The first dry run

Start one with **Run now** and read the session. Then check the repository: a dry
run writes nothing, so there must be no new comment, label, branch, or PR. Confirm
what the routines documentation does not promise:

- [ ] **The command ran.** The session followed `/work-next-item` rather than reading
  it as plain text. If it did not, make the prompt: "Follow
  .claude/commands/work-next-item.md with the arguments --dry-run".
- [ ] **GitHub access works.** It listed issues, through `gh` or the GitHub MCP tools,
  without a 403.
- [ ] **The deny rules apply.** Start a separate one-off run with the prompt "Run
  `git push --dry-run origin HEAD:main` and report whether permission settings
  denied it". The push sends nothing either way. If it was not denied, the repo's
  `.claude/settings.json` is not in effect: GitHub sees the routine as you, so only
  the command's own instructions stop it merging its PRs. Do not go live in that
  case.
- [ ] **It picked the right issue**: the one you would pick, skipping `no-auto-heal`,
  `blocked`, and unapproved proposals.
- [ ] **Its proposal is worth approving.** The dry-run report includes the full text
  it would post.
- [ ] **How long a run takes.** Runs must not overlap (below).

## Go live

After a few dry runs look right, change the prompt to `/work-next-item`. Keep the
gate on.

## While it runs

- **One runner per repository.** Do not run the loop locally while the routine is
  live, and keep runs well inside the interval. If runs approach an hour, schedule
  every 2 hours or more. Claims are a backstop for when this slips (#57): every
  claim is a comment naming the run and its checkout. Step 0 leaves alone a claim
  younger than three hours, recovers older ones, and recovers a claim from its own
  checkout at once. Its limits:
  - A manual or `/loop` session does not take the lock, so two sessions in one
    checkout can take each other's claim for a dead run's.
  - A run that dies with a local-only branch (never pushed) leaves nothing a cloud
    run can see. After three hours the cloud run starts the issue over, and the
    local work turns up later under `abandoned/`.
- **Approve a proposal** by adding `heal:approved`. The next run implements it and
  opens a PR assigned to you. For a fresh proposal instead, edit the issue and remove
  `heal:proposed`.
- **Hold back one issue** with `no-auto-heal` or `blocked`. **Stop everything** by
  pausing the routine on claude.ai/code/routines.
- **Ask for changes on a PR** by commenting on it and adding `changes-requested` to
  the PR. A later run makes them on the same branch. Runs also fix a PR's failing
  checks and merge conflicts before starting new work. After three follow-ups with no
  word from you, the issue is handed back as `needs-attention`; the PR stays open.
- **Merging stays yours**, as with every other way of running the loop.

## Cadence and usage

Hourly is the default. The schedule lives in the routine, not the repository, so
change it there, with `/schedule` or on claude.ai/code/routines. Each run counts
against your Claude plan's usage like an interactive session. A run that finds
nothing actionable stops after a few listings; one that implements an issue costs
about what working it locally does. Routines also have per-account caps on runs per
hour.
